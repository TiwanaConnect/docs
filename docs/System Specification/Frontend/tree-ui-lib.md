## üîç UI Library Options

| Library            | Pros                                         | Cons                            |
|--------------------|----------------------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| `react-d3-tree`    | Mature, zoom/pan, fit to screen, huge usage  | Complex customization, SVG-only|
| `family-tree.js`   | Purely for family trees, plug-n-play         | Less flexible, not maintained   |
| `react-family-tree`| Simple, easy to use                          | Weak docs, needs custom styles  |
| `react-flow`       | Modern, powerful flow renderer               | Too generic, needs tweaking     |
| Custom Canvas/SVG  | Full control                                 | Long effort, not for v1         |
